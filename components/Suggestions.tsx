Recent chat messages:
- They said they're excited about next week's NFT drop.
- I shared a music playlist and they loved it.
- They mentioned feeling a bit overwhelmed with work.

My notes:
About Them:
Very creative, introverted. Likes climbing and DAOs.
They mentioned wanting to collaborate on a project.

My Intentions:
Iâ€™d like to build a real friendship and maybe even explore a joint NFT idea.
Would love to support them when theyâ€™re stressed.

Whatâ€™s a good message to send next?
